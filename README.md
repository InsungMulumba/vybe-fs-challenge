# vybe-fs-challenge

- Backend and Frontend in seperate folders at root of repo
- Each project can be run by navigating to folder and running `npm i` to install dependencies and then `npm run dev` to start dev server
- Frontend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`
- Backend will run on `http://localhost:3000/`
- backend consists of three endpoints that returns the data for the 3 required charts
- Apexcharts was used to complete frontend charts, I discovered an issue with the library that prevents it from being properly tested [link](https://github.com/apexcharts/react-apexcharts/issues/425). Unable to complete full test coverage but happy to discuss test approaches in person
